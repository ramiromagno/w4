Description: Routines to find the roots of nonlinear functions using the W4
    method <doi:10.1016/j.apnum.2022.08.019>. The W4 method may be regarded as
    an extension to the Newton-Raphson (NR) method where the iterative method
    solves a second-order time-evolution system. Relative to the NR method, the
    W4 method provides a wider convergence region (Newton basin) at the cost of
    converging only linearly (the NR method converges quadratically). Therefore
    the W4 method may be preferable to the NR method if global convergence is
    the priority.
